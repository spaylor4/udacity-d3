## Notes from Lesson 4: Design Principles

A cartogram is a map with shapes resized in proportion to some metric instead of true geographic size.

[Cycle plots](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/guests/intro_to_cycle_plots.pdf) can show trends over
time and within groupings (e.g. day of week).

[Connected scatter plots](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2012/09/in-praise-of-connected-scatter-plots.html)
can be used to show changing relationships between two variables over time. These can be an alternative to animated scatter plots.
