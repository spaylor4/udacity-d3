## Notes from Lesson 4: Design Principles

While familiar with most of the charts covered in this lesson, a few caught my eye as unfamiliar or as views I recognized but didn't know the name for:

* A cartogram is a map with shapes resized in proportion to some metric instead of true geographic size.

* [Cycle plots](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/guests/intro_to_cycle_plots.pdf) can show trends over time and within groupings (e.g. day of week).

* [Connected scatter plots](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2012/09/in-praise-of-connected-scatter-plots.html) can be used to show changing relationships between two variables over time. These can be an alternative to animated scatter plots.
